# Year 8 Coding Investigation

## Requirements
1. Get input of the lighting condition
2. Get the User to input 2 of the settings
3. Try recommending the 3rd setting, if its not possible tell the user how many stops to adjust by


## Defenitions
### ISO
ISO is the light sensitivity. The larger it is the more sensitive to light hence doubling the ISO
results in the image being twice as bright.

* The higher the ISO, the brighter the image
* The higher the ISO the more noisy the image

### Shutter Speed
Shutter speed is the length of time (in seconds) that the shutter is open.

* The longer the shutter is open the brighter the image.
* The shorter the shutter is open the less motion blur is in the image

### Aperture
The aperture changes size based on the f-stop number. The larger it is the more light is let in.

* The large the aperture the brighter it is
* The smaller the aperture the large the depth of field


### Modified Sunny 16 Rule
TBD
